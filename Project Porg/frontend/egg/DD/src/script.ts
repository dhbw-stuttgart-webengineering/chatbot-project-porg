// This setup is designed to be editable, and to become something like a game
// engine. As of now, there are only few types of tile may be inserted into
// the game map. Those are the below, and its usage.
//
// S -> The starting point.
// F -> Escape door.
// K -> Key to open the locked door.
// L -> Locked door. How to input: L_x-y where x is the x index (of array)
//      of K, and y is the y index. Array is declared as 2 dimensional array.
// W -> Wall. You can't pass here.
// T -> Tree. You can't pass here.
// B -> Barrel. You can't pass here.
// M -> Monster. Don't go here, you'll lose.
// <space> -> Floor where you can walk.
